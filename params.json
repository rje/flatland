{"name":"Flatland","body":"## What?\r\nFlatland is a simple 2d game engine written in C++ with a javascript front-end.  The goal is to develop a system that allows you to quickly iterate on your game ideas and easily package your project for a variety of platforms.\r\n\r\n## Where?\r\nInitially flatland supports Windows, OS X, and Linux, with iOS and Android also on the TODO list.  I'm also eyeing WebGL as a platform target to look at.\r\n\r\n## Why?\r\nJavascript is one of the most accessible languages out there right now, and it can be a joy to work with.  We're trying to provide an environment where people can test out game ideas quickly, and once the ideas are validated they can flesh out their full game within the same environment.  Having a minimalistic framework is also great to bootstrap tool development, and I'm hoping the nature of the engine will allow all of us to share tools to make the engine even better.\r\n\r\n## How?\r\nWant to download a build? Take a look here. There are some tutorials to get started, and here are the full docs for the javascript api.\r\n\r\nWant to grab the source and build it from scratch? Take a look at the [Build instructions](flatland/wiki/Building).\r\n\r\n## Want to know more?\r\nFollow me [on twitter](http://twitter.com/rje) and harass me about the project, and let me know if you're doing something cool with it!","tagline":"","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
